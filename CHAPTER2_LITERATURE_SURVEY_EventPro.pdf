LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1 REVIEW OF LITERATURE SURVEY

1. Web-Based Event Management Systems
A. K. Tripathy, S. K. Rath, and A. K. Nayak, in their paper “Web-based Event Management System” [1], discuss the design and implementation of a web-based event management system that automates the process of event planning, vendor management, and attendee registration. The authors highlight the importance of integrating modules such as user authentication, vendor listing, and real-time notifications to improve efficiency and user experience. Their findings support the adoption of modular, scalable architectures for modern event management platforms.

2. Vendor Selection and Bidding Mechanisms
S. S. S. R. Depuru, L. Wang, and V. Devabhaktuni, in “A conceptual design using a bidding mechanism for vendor selection in e-procurement” [2], analyze the effectiveness of automated bidding and vendor selection mechanisms in online platforms. The study demonstrates that transparent bidding processes and automated evaluation criteria enhance fairness and efficiency in vendor selection, which is directly applicable to event management systems like EventPro.

3. Real-Time Communication in Event Platforms
In “A Real-Time Web-Based Event Notification System” [3], S. S. S. R. Depuru et al. present a system that utilizes real-time web technologies to deliver instant notifications and updates to users. The paper emphasizes the role of technologies such as WebSockets and RESTful APIs in improving communication between event organizers and vendors, reducing delays and enhancing user engagement.

4. User Experience and Interface Design
A. Hussain, S. Mkpojiogu, and Y. Kamal, in “The Influence of User Interface Design on User Experience with Web-Based Event Management Systems” [4], investigate the impact of UI/UX design on user satisfaction and system adoption. Their research concludes that intuitive navigation, responsive layouts, and clear feedback mechanisms are critical for the success of event management platforms.

5. Data Security and Privacy in Event Management Systems
In “Security and Privacy in Web-Based Event Management Systems: A Review” [5], M. A. Ferrag et al. review the security challenges and solutions for protecting user data and transactions in event management platforms. The authors recommend the use of secure authentication, encrypted data storage, and compliance with data protection regulations to ensure user trust and system reliability.
