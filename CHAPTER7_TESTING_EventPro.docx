CHAPTER 7
TESTING

7.1 TESTING METHODOLOGY

Testing documentation is the documentation of artifacts that are created during or before the testing of a software application. Documentation reflects the importance of processes for the customer, individual, and organization. Projects which contain all documents have a high level of maturity. Careful documentation can save the time, efforts, and wealth of the organization.

If the testing or development team gets software that is not working correctly and developed by someone else, so to find the error, the team will first need a document. Now, if the documents are available then the team will quickly find out the cause of the error by examining documentation. But, if the documents are not available then the tester needs to do black box and white box testing again, which will waste the time and money of the organization. More than that, lack of documentation becomes a problem for acceptance.

Benefits of using Documentation:
- Documentation clarifies the quality of methods and objectives.
- It ensures internal coordination when a customer uses the software application.
- It ensures clarity about the stability of tasks and performance.
- It provides feedback on preventive tasks and for your planning cycle.
- It creates objective evidence for the performance of the quality management system.

The test scenario is a detailed document of test cases that cover end-to-end functionality of a software application in linear statements. The test scenario is a high-level classification of testable requirements. These requirements are grouped on the basis of the functionality of a module and obtained from the use cases. In the test scenario, there is a detailed testing process due to many associated test cases. Before performing the test scenario, the tester has to consider the test cases for each scenario. In the test scenario, testers need to put themselves in the place of the user because they test the software application under the user's point of view.

As per the IEEE Documentation, describing plans for, or results of, the testing of a system or component, types include test case specification, test incident report, test log, test plan, test procedure, and test report. Hence, the testing of all the above-mentioned documents is known as documentation testing. This is one of the most cost-effective approaches to testing. If the documentation is not right, there will be major and costly problems. The documentation can be tested in a number of different ways to many different degrees of complexity. These range from running the documents through a spelling and grammar checking device, to manually reviewing the documentation to remove any ambiguity or inconsistency. Documentation testing can start at the very beginning of the software process and hence save large amounts of money, since the earlier a defect is found the less it will cost to be fixed.

Key Testing Documentation Files:
- Test strategy: An outline of the full approach to product testing.
- Test data: The data that testers enter into the software to verify certain features and their outputs.
- Test plans: A file that describes the strategy, resources, environment, limitations, and schedule of the testing process.
- Test scenarios: Testers break down the product's functionality and interface by modules and provide real-time status updates at all testing stages.
- Test cases: Step-by-step guidance, detailed conditions, and current inputs of a testing task.
- Traceability Matrix: Maps test cases and their requirements.
